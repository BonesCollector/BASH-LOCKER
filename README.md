# BASH-LOCKER
A small none complex terminal locker more of a fun than a reliable script 

My very first script in bash 
feel free to edit according to your need i claim no responsibility nor 
rights , i obtained a hash by running the command :
echo "PASS" | md5sum | tr -d "-" | tr -d " " 
then just used PASS to unlock , felts  more secure than using my plain 
pass .
